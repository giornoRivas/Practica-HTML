                <h3>My Decision Making Process</h3>
                <ul>
                   <li>
                    <p><span class="div1-span">Color:</span>I started off by sampling colors from an actual picture of an orange .I ended up with something that represented an orange well , but had a color scheme that didn't fit together very harmoniously. Finding similar colors from compatible section of the color wheel made my compisition as united as it is now . The Yellos , Oranges and golds are very nice</p></li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="main-div2">
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    <p><span class="div2-span">Target Audience:</span>My idea for this design came when someone asked me if I wanted a smoothie and I asked them what king they were making . They responded. I don't know i just want something cold and fruily now .That's my target audience,those who would like a could fruity beverage and do NOT want to wait!</p></li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="main-div3">
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    <p><span class="div3-span">Design:</span>My Logo is simply an orangey citrus shape with clock hand on it. The idea is to suggested to the mind that the products my company deliver are fast and efficient. The fonts were carrefully chosen to send a message.The font featured in the logo had a very tropical fun feel to me that I thought worked well .The body copu seemed professional but went well with my header font.</p></li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="main-div4">

                    <li>
                    <p><span class="div4-span">Tools/Tricks</span>Idepended a lot here on the pen tool I was ablve to draw out a perfect citrus section with it .Then Iwas helped a lot by the rotation tool.Iwas able to rotate it perfectly around the center point , and the repeat action tool let me make copies that formed a complete circle.</p></li>
